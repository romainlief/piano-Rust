# üéπ Synthesizer in Rust

This project is a synthesizer in Rust made with cpal and device_query.

## Features

- **Polyphonic Piano**: Play multiple notes simultaneously
- **Multiple Synthesizers**: 5 different types of synthesizers with their own characteristics
- **Real-time**: Instant response to keyboard keys
- **Advanced Control**: Customize parameters for each synthesizer
- **High-quality audio**: Uses CPAL for professional audio reproduction
